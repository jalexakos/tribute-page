        <p id="list-header">10 Things You Probably Didn't Know About J.R.R. Tolkien</p>
        <ul class="list-head">
            <li class="list-item">By the age of four, Tolkien could read and write fluently. This was clearly a foreshadowing of his incredible talent for languages, cultures, and mythologies.</li>
            <li class="list-item">He was a soldier in the First World War, and even fought in the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme">Battle of the Somme</a>. This experience, which for most soldiers was profoundly troubling, deeply shaped his conscience and overall sense of right and wrong. It also played a role in his distrust of industrialization.</li>
            <li class="list-item">His travels greatly influenced his writing. Specifically, his travels in Switzerland, and the profound beauty of the country, played a role in the landscape aesthetics of the elves in his books.</li>
            <li class="list-item">His relationship with his wife, Edith, inspired his characters Beren and Lúthien, whose love story played an important role in his legendarium. Beren was a mortal man and Lúthien an immmortal Elf, which some believe represented the disapproval Edith's family felt about their marriage (as Tolkien was Catholic and her family was not).</li>
            <li class="list-item">Tolkien learned almost twenty languages in his lifetime, including Medieval Welsh. His passion for languages and cultures is reflected in the care that went into his world-building in his fantasies, as he crafted entire languages (fourteen of them!) and histories for the different races (men, elves, dwarves, and more) in his stories.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Tolkien was part of a literary society called "The Inklings". Consisting of himself, fellow fantasy writer and professor C.S. Lewis, poet and novelist Charles Williams, and philosopher and novelist Owen Barfield, this group meet in a pub in Oxford with great frequency. They discussed numerous topics, and read aloud pieces of their work as they were developing them.</li>
            <li class="list-item">While in the midst of grading papers one day, the famous first words of <i>The Hobbit</i> came to him. “In a hole in the ground lived a hobbit”.</li>
            <li class="list-item">In 1972, Tolkien was given the Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his works in literature by Queen Elizabeth II. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire">The Order</a> "is a British order of chivalry, rewarding contributions to the arts and sciences, work with charitable and welfare organisations, and public service outside the civil service."</li>
            <li class="list-item">Many of Tolkien's unpublished works and notes were published posthumously by his son, Christopher. Christopher, a passionate fan and lover of the mythos, carefully edited the works before publishing them.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Both <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> were turned into blockbuster trilogies, directed by Peter Jackson. Both starred Christopher Lee as the powerful wizard Saruman. Lee was not only a great actor, but had actually met Tolkien personally many years prior, and was a huge fan of his work.</li>
